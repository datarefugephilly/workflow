## Crawlable vs. Harvested

At the [Researching](researching.md) stage, Researchers investigate to determine whether each URL listed in the [Archivers app](http://www.archivers.space/urls) needs to be manually downloaded (harvested) or if it can, in fact, be automatically saved (crawled) by the Internet Archive. 

The URLs [listed under Crawlable](http://www.archivers.space/urls?phase=crawlable) were determined to be crawlable and were submitted to the  Internet Archive. For more information, please refer to the [Researching](researching.md) documentation.

## Are all crawlable URLs listed under Crawlable?

No. The URLs listed under Crawlable in the [Archivers app](http://www.archivers.space/urls?phase=crawlable) represent only a small portion of all the URLs submitted to the Internet Archive by Data Rescue events. 
- Most crawlable URLs are spotted by [Seeders](seeding.md) at the beginning of the workflow, and are submitted directly to the Internet Archive, thereby completely bypassing the Archivers app. 
- When Seeders find URLs that seem hard to crawl, they send them to the Archivers app as "uncrawlable".
- At that point [Researchers](researching.md) will do the much more thorough investigation mentioned above, and might find out the dataset to be crawlable after all. For instance, perhaps a slightly different URL needed to be used.
