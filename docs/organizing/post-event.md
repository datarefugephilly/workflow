## Key Steps

1. **Schedule a debrief call** with EDGI regarding the Seeding status using the [Agency Primers](https://envirodatagov.org/agencyprimers/)
1. **Follow up about the final disposition of the data** with [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/) and [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/)
    - Are there large datasets that need to be uploaded to S3 by an authorized person?
    - Has someone taken responsibility for handing seeds off to the Internet Archive?
1. **Provide feedback about the event** processes to other DataRescue groups

## Ongoing Involvement

DataRescue is a coalition and a movement. When the event is over, and exhaustion is setting in over a couple of rounds... there is still work to do.

- Participants might want to continue the work started at the event, this is possible as our workflow is meant to function in-person as well as remotely.
- There are emerging opportunities posted in the [DataRefuge](https://rauchg-slackin-qonsfhhvxs.now.sh/) and [Archivers](https://archivers-slack.herokuapp.com/) Slack teams about how to be involved in the data protection movement to contribute your ideas, energy, and good will to building a sustainable future for knowledge.
