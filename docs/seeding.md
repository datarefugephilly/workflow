## What Do Seeders Do?

Seeders canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the Internet Archive's web crawler. If the URLs are crawlable, the Seeders nominate them to the [End of Term (EOT) Web Archive](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/2016.html). Otherwise, they add them to the Uncrawlable spreadsheet using the project's Chrome Extension.

## Choosing the Website

Seeders use the [EDGI Archiving Primers](https://envirodatagov.org/archiving/), or a similar set of resources, to identify important and at-risk data. Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

## Canvassing the Website and Evaluating Content

- Start exploring the website assigned, identifying important URLs.
- Decide whether the data on a page or website subsection can be automatically captured by the Internet Archive web crawler.
- [EDGI's Guides](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/) have information critical to the seeding and sorting process:
    - [Understanding the Internet Archive Web Crawler](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/internet-archive-crawler/)
    - [Seeding the Internet Archive’s Web Crawler](https://edgi-govdata-archiving.github.io/guides/seeding-internet-archive/)

### Crawlable URLs

- URLs judged to be crawlable are "nominated" (equivalently, "seeded") to the End of Term project (EOT), using the [EDGI Nomination Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nominationtool/abjpihafglmijnkkoppbookfkkanklok?hl=en) or

**Wherever possible, add in the Agency Office Code from the sub-primer.** Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

### Uncrawlable URLs

- If URL is judged not crawlable, add it to the "Uncrawlable" spreadsheet through the Chrome Extension.
- In the spreadsheet the URL is automatically associated with a universal unique identifyer (UUID) that was generated in advance.
- You can check whether the page or some files are archived using the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak)

### Not Sure?

- This sorting is only provisional; when in doubt, Seeders nominate the URL **and** mark it as possibly not crawlable.
