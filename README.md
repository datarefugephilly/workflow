# DataRescue Workflow

This guide describes the [DataRescue workflow](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/) we use for Data Rescue activites as developed by the [DataRefuge project](http://www.ppehlab.org/) and [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/), both at in-person events and when people work remotely. It explains the process that a url/dataset goes through from the time it has been identified, either by a [seeder & sorter](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/seednsort/) as "uncrawlable," or by other means, until it is made available as a record in the [datarefuge.org](http://www.datarefuge.org) ckan data catalog. The process involves several stages, and is designed to maximize smooth hand-offs so that each phase is handled by someone with distinct expertise in the area they're tackling, while the data is always being tracked for security.

## Are you looking for the actual documentation?
We have moved the documentation to a more user-friendly format. You can now find the guide [here](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/).

Note that we are still working on it, and will shortly add screenshots, etc.
